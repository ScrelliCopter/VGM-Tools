# [VGM-Tools](https://github.com/ScrelliCopter/VGM-Tools)

Personal scratch pad for various VGM extraction/transformation projects.

Tools that are used in scripts are usually included in-tree and may be out of date or augmented from their upstream versions.

All original code is Zlib licensed (see COPYING.zlib for details), other copyrights will be specified where appropriate.

This repository is in a constant state of flux and things may not work or compile at any one time, you may want to look at the [Releases](https://github.com/ScrelliCopter/VGM-Tools/releases) tab for snapshots of the repository that may prove more useful.

The tools herein are primarily made for my own use or some kind of one-off problem, but they are provided here in the hopes they may be useful to someone.
